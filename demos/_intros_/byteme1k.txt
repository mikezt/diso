                                                         title: BYTE ME!

I wrote something for Forever. I wanted to do it. This is it. It's shit.

The sound is crap, but sounded nice in emulation on my works PC.  Sorry!

Greets to : all party organisers, all party visitors, all zx users (demo
or otherwise), all 8-bit users (keepy the sceney alivey), all demo-scene
peoples, all non-demo-scene peoples, and anyone who just feels lonely...

Special greets, hugs, and kisses to Nella, the raww.orgy mascot. Lovely!
