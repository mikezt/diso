Greetings for all JHcon 2015 visitors !!!

This is the first monochrome multicolor intro (maybe ever).
It runs in virtual resolution 128x128 pixels, 9 shades of grey.

You can see 32 textures in size 32x32 for sprites
and the same textures but size 128x96 for background.

There is a very simple 30 seconds AY 50Hz background link.
Music routine takes 77 bytes and data 16 bytes.

On BSDOS, code of the selected intro is runable by NEW.

                                Busy and Noro.
