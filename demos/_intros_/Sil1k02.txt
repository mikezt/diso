Hello,

This is a special version of my series "Song in lines"
but all code and music are designed as 1k intro,
it means all code and music fits 1024 bytes.

In the intro, there is a title at begin.
You can skip short waiting during the title
by pressing any key (no shift). There is
no any control keys in the main part of intro.

Main graphic effect repeats after cca one minute.
But in fact, repeat comes after very long time
because repeating of effects is processed
with another coordinates of lines.

On the background, a short AY 50Hz music plays.
This is the shortest Noro's music what was used ever.
Music routine takes 280 bytes and data 169 bytes.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is runable by NEW.

			Busy and Noro.
