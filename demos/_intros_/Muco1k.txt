Hello,

This intro is a special 1k remake
of the Multicolor shadevision part of Echology.

Intro contains 19 multicolor textures in resolution 64x32.
Some of them have 2 and other 3 variants of displaying.

There are a (not so short) AY 50Hz music, over 2 minutes long.
Music routine takes 179 bytes and data 95 bytes.

Due to different timing and contended ram banks
of 128/+2 and +2A/+3, the intro comes in two versions:
first one compiled for 128/+2 and second one for +2A/+3.
You can run both version on both types of computer,
but then you get destroyed multicolor.
In the TAP file, there are both version of intro
with simple program for detect right type of computer.

On BSDOS, code of the selected intro is runable by NEW.

	Busy and Noro.
