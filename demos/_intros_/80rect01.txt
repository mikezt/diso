This 1k intro is a ZX Spectrum port
of well known Raster's intro from Atari:
http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=62186

You will see 80 random moving rectangles,
it means 18560 moving pixels at 50 FPS.

Due to different timing of some Speccy
models, the intro comes in two versions:
First one (80rect128) is optimized for 128/+2 only
and second one (80rect48) is generic for all other
models running on 3.5-4 MHz (48,+2A,+3,Didaktik M).
Running of 80rect128 on +2A/+3 is possible but
due to slower contended ram it is not recomended
(there is no problem with memory layout of slower
128 ram banks, but with slower contended ram itself).

In the TAP file, there are both version of intro
with simple program for detect right type of computer.

If you want to use this intro on modern Speccy clones
running on 6+ MHz, please use 80rect128 version.
Using 80rect48 in this case can cause flicking problems.

On BSDOS, code of the intro is runable by NEW command.

And at the end, a little info for Atari users:
This intro DOES NOT USE the index registers
and any indexed adressing modes of the Z80-CPU :)
