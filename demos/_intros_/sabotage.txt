                had be used by me;)
J7n's note:     This is our 2nd 4K work. The 1st was
                an 'SkY', which was failed on CC'000,
                because of unstable data bus on Copper
                Feet's pentagon;(. So, this intro has'nt
                this mistake (i.e. has a 257 bytes interrupt
                table).
                If you have some questions, please, write
                me! I'm (hope, not only me) interests for
                appearence of young and cool (and mainly
                lazyless!;)) coders on speccy scene.
                Maybe, the sources of this strange intro
                (khe-khe:), will be public soon, if anybody
                asks me, ofcourse...
