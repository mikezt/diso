The Game of life is very known game about evolution of an array of cells,
where the new state (alive or dead) depends to previous state of the cell
and states of its all 8 neighbors. By other words, it is simple cellular
automaton where initial state determines whole further evolution process.

The rules

  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive
  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive

Key features

  Optimized for speed
  Resolution: 256x192 cells
  Speed: 1.14 FPS = 56000 pix/s
  Counters for cells and generations
  One and half of minute ACB stereo music
  Included basic for playing with the intro

Control keys

    M ..... Music on/off
    N ..... Numbers on/off
  Space ... Return to basic

  The keys are checked when cell generation is
  updated, so please hold the keys for one second.

Additional information

  This intro is extended version of "Life512b"
  intro released on LoveByte party 2024,
  the counters and ACB stereo music was added.

  Intro needs ZX Spectrum 128k with two videorams.
  It does not work in 48k mode or ZX Spectrum 48k.

  If you want play with intro in basic,
  it is recomended to load intro in USR 0 mode
  due to overwriting system variables of 128 editor.

Playing with intro

  Intro comes with loading basic what allows you
  to play with intro. Important parts in basic:

     10 to 30 .... Run intro with random init cells
     50 to 120 ... Run intro with your own cells
    150 to 180 ... Continue in existing evolution

  You can set counter color by using

    POKE 37115,value

  where the "value" means attribute for counter digits.
  Please apply this POKE after first executing of intro.
  (before executing it has no effect due to depacking)

  Since intro occupies (nearly) whole basic memory,
  the ramtop is set to 24575. When you want to execute
  the intro with your own init state of cells and
  there is not enough space for your basic drawing,
  you can delete whole basic (NEW helps you :) ),
  then write your own drawing and after the drawing,
  add these two commands for executing of intro:

    RANDOMIZE 16384
    RANDOMIZE USR 32768

  We hope you have a lot of fun with this intro  :)
