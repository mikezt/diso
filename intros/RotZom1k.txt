Hello,

This is a special version of my Rotazoomer
but all code and music are designed as 1k intro,
it means all code and music fits 1024 bytes.

Intro contains 8 textures what are rotating,
moving and zooming on screen. Each texture is
displaying about 32 second, so all graphics
takes about 256 seconds = 4 and 1/2 minutes.

On the background, a short AY 50Hz music plays.
Music routine takes 227 bytes and data 153 bytes.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is runable by NEW.

			Busy and Noro.
