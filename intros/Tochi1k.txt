Hello,

This is some simple attribute rotation effect
with colour palette changing in real time.

For enhancing colour palette, 25Hz mixing is used
so there can be some flickering problems on emulators
or any devices what uses no native 50 FPS displaying.

There is possibility to switch off the flickering
by disabling 25Hz colour mixing by POKE 33336,0
but in this case intro will not use full palette.

There are a short AY 50Hz music, over 2 minute long.
Music routine takes 171 bytes and data 236 bytes.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is directly runable by NEW.

                      Busy and Noro.
