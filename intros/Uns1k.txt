Hello,

This is a special version
of the classic "Unlimited sprites" effect
but all code and music are designed as 1k intro.

Intro contains 16 textures 32x32 for sprites
and 7 textures for moving background.

There are a short AY 50Hz music, 20.48 seconds long.
Music routine takes 112 bytes and data 52 bytes.

Due to different configuration of contended ram banks
on 128/+2 and +2A/+3, the intro comes in two versions:
first one compiled for 128/+2 and second one for +2A/+3.
You can run both version on both types of computer,
but then you get some timing problems (flicking of counter).
In the TAP file, there are both version of intro
with simple program for detect right type of computer.

On BSDOS, code of the selected intro is runable by NEW.

		Busy and Noro.
