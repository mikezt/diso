TIC-TOC Intro (ZX Spectrum 48k)
by
Daniel A. Nagy <nagydani@epointsystem.org>
for the 1k intro competition at
FOReVER 2019

Special thanks to Slavo "Busy" Labsky for encouragement and inspiration.

The 1k intro file is tic-toc.tap that renders an animation and plays it.
Unfortunately, it takes many days to finish the rendering, so I provided
a snapshot with the rendered video and its player in tic-toc-player.tap

The whole thing was inspired by the Juggler demo for Amiga 1000 from 1986.
The humble 48k Speccy could have done that waaay back in 1982.

A more sophisticated version for the 128k Spectrum might follow...
