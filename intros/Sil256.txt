Hello,

This is graphic part of my known 1k intro "Song in lines"
created as new separate 256-byte intro.

Main graphic effect repeats after cca two minutes. But in fact,
repeat comes after very long time because repeating of effects
is processed with another coordinates of lines.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is runable directly by NEW command.

			Busy.
