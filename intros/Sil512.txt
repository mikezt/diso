Hello,

This is a special version of my series "Song in lines"
but all code and music are designed as 512 intro,
it means all code and music fits 512 bytes.

Main graphic effect repeats after cca two minutes.
But in fact, repeat comes after very long time
because repeating of effects is processed
with another coordinates of lines.

On the background, a short AY 50Hz music plays.
This is the shortest Noro's music what was used till now.

A short statistics:
 Graphics routine: 245 bytes
    Music routine: 126 bytes
       Music data:  69 bytes
     Service code:  72 bytes
 Service code is credit, im2 and other.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is runable directly by NEW command.

					Busy and Noro.
