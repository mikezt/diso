		also, big thank you to Phil Wilde and Jean-Paul De Coster for producing "No limit".

		i very much hope that a certain group whose name i plagiarised for this demo does not mind (too much).
		most of the code is written by introspec, with a couple of great suggestions by psndcj^tbk.
		the interrupt alignment code is inspired by Alone Coder's routine from the supplement to ZX-Guide #3.
		this demo uses the arbitrary delay routine written by Jan Bobrowski for his software "minfo".
		the fully commented source code of the demo is available upon a request.
