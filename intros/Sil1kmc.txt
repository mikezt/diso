Hello,

This is a special 1k version of multicolor
"Song in lines" part of Echology demo,
but all code and music are designed as 1k intro,
it means all code and music fits 1024 bytes.

Main graphic effect repeats after cca two minutes.
But in fact, repeat comes after very long time
because repeating of effects is processed
with another coordinates of lines.

There are a short AY 50Hz music, over 1 minute long.
Music routine takes 175 bytes and data 222 bytes.

Multicolor in this intro is timed only for original
ZX Spectrum 128k / +2 / +2A / +3. There can be
destroyed displaying on other clones than 128k.

You can run this intro on 48kB models too but
in this case, you will not see any graphics.
If you have AY, the music will be played.

Intro comes with a basic loader, but on BSDOS,
code of the intro is runable by NEW.

                      Busy and Noro.
