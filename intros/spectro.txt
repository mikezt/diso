Spectro by Optimus/Dirty Minds
------------------------------

Hi there!

This is my first crappy attempt at coding something for Zx Spectrum. Crappy bobs, ugly attribute plasma. With bugz.
I am officially coding for Speccy now and I love Speccy because I am Optimouse :)

For my next Speccy demo I will take more time (this was just a fast hack I did in a hurry during my netcafe hours) and I will probably configure SDCC in the same way as my CPC/PC framework. It's gonna rule for deving!

The intro seems to work in every Speccy I try on emul. Gotta try it in my 48k at home too.
