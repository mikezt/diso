DISO (Demfir ISO) - This is the source for compiling ISO image for ZX Spectrum + DivIDE interface with DEMFIR firmware.

The aim of this project is to have decent TAP files of most known ZX Spectrum software on one place. Decent TAP file means it have simple BASIC loader if it's possible and it correctly runs on ZX Spectrum / 128k with divIDE connected (USR0).
